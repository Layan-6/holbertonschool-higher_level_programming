# Python - More Data Structures

This directory explores advanced data structures in Python, including sets, dictionaries, and their common operations, as well as functional programming tools like `map`, `filter`, and `lambda`.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand and use sets and dictionaries in Python
- Perform common operations: union, intersection, difference, etc.
- Use comprehensions for lists, sets, and dictionaries
- Work with `lambda`, `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` functions
- Handle complex nested data structures

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.*
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all Python files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Code must follow pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable
- Modules and functions should have documentation

## Project Structure
- **0-square_matrix_simple.py** – Compute the square of each integer in a matrix
- **1-search_replace.py** – Replace all occurrences of an element in a list
- **2-uniq_add.py** – Add all unique integers in a list
- **3-common_elements.py** – Find common elements in two sets
- **4-only_diff_elements.py** – Find elements present in only one set
- **5-number_keys.py** – Count the number of keys in a dictionary
- **6-print_sorted_dictionary.py** – Print a dictionary by ordered keys
- **7-update_dictionary.py** – Update or add a key/value in a dictionary
- **8-simple_delete.py** – Delete a key from a dictionary
- **9-multiply_by_2.py** – Multiply all dictionary values by 2
- **10-best_score.py** – Find the key with the highest integer value
- **11-multiply_list_map.py** – Multiply each element of a list using `map`
- **12-roman_to_int.py** – Convert a Roman numeral to an integer (optional)

## Usage
Each script can be run independently or imported as a module.

```bash
./0-square_matrix_simple.py
