# Python - if/else, loops, functions

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum, focusing on core Python concepts such as:

- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops (`while`, `for`)
- Functions (definition, parameters, return values)
- Basic Python operators and control flow

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to use conditionals and loops in Python
- Learn to write reusable functions
- Practice using the Python interpreter
- Get familiar with Python's style guide (PEP8/pycodestyle)

## Requirements
- All files must be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.*
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all Python files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Code must follow pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable

## Project Structure
The directory includes tasks that cover:
- Basic conditionals (positive/negative, last digit)
- Loops (printing numbers, ASCII alphabet)
- Functions (power, uppercase, etc.)
- Combining conditionals, loops, and functions
