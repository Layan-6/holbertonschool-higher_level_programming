# Python - Everything is object

This project focuses on understanding how Python handles objects, references, and memory.
It covers key concepts such as:
- What is an object
- The difference between mutable and immutable types
- Aliasing and assignment
- Identity vs equality
- Using `id()` and `type()`
- How Python stores and manages objects in memory

The tasks in this project help build a strong foundation for understanding how Python works internally.
