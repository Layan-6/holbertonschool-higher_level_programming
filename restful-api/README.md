# RESTful API Project

## Overview
This project covers the fundamentals of RESTful APIs, including HTTP/HTTPS basics, API consumption, development, security, and documentation.

## Learning Objectives
1. Understand HTTP/HTTPS protocols and their differences
2. Consume APIs using command-line tools and Python
3. Develop APIs using Python's `http.server` and Flask framework
4. Implement API security and authentication
5. Create API documentation using OpenAPI standards

## Project Structure

### Task 0: Basics of HTTP/HTTPS
- Understanding the fundamental differences between HTTP and HTTPS
- Exploring HTTP request/response structure
